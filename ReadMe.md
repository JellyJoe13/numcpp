# NumCPP
NumCPP is meant to be a replacement for numpy in c++ in a very basic way currently as numpy is a very large framework
that is able to use LAPACK and BLAS routines which the author of this repo finds hard to install.

Furthermore this project was also meant to be a warmup to C++ after a 2 years break of not using it.

Feel free to use, if you think you can improve some things let me know and we can start a collab on it.
